// Q.15 Calculate the slope, x-intercept and y-intercept of y = 2x -2

/*

By converting the given eq in standard form we get 2x-y-2=0

Therefore,
a = 2;
b = -1;
c = -2;

And,
slope = -a/b
slope = -2/-1
x-intercept = -c/a
x-intercept = -(-2)/2
y-intercept = -c/b
y-intercept = -(-2)/(-1)

*/

let a = 2;
let b = -1;
let c = -2;

let slope = -a / b;

let xIntercept = -c / a;

let yIntercept = -c / b;

console.log(`slope is ${slope}`);
console.log(`x-intercept is ${xIntercept}`);
console.log(`y-intercept is ${yIntercept}`);

/*
 OUTPUT

slope is 2
x-intercept is 1
y-intercept is -2
